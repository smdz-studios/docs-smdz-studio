## 🔁 How to Add a New Script Page

1. Duplicate `scripts/example-script.md`.
2. Rename it to match your script name, for example:
   - `scripts/smdz_vehicleshop.md`
   - `scripts/smdz_dispatch.md`
3. Edit the duplicated file and replace all placeholder fields.
4. Add an entry in this file:

```markdown
- **[SMDZ Vehicle Shop](smdz_vehicleshop.md)** – Advanced vehicle shop system.
```

5. (Optional) Add a direct link in `/_sidebar.md` under the **Scripts** section.

This keeps your SMDZ documentation **organized**, **coherent**, and easy to grow as your script library expands.
