To help you quickly and avoid “back and forth” questions, please include the following information in your first message:

1. **Script name**  
   - Example: `smdz_example`, `smdz_vehicleshop`, `smdz_dispatch`, etc.

2. **Script version**  
   - Example: `v1.0.3` (check the config file, manifest or the Tebex download page).

3. **Framework and version**
   - ESX / QBCore / Standalone.  
   - Include the framework version if relevant (for example “ESX Legacy”, specific QBCore commit, etc.).

4. **Tebex purchase ID**
   - The **order ID / transaction ID** from Tebex that proves your purchase.

5. **Clear description of the issue**
   - What you expected to happen.  
   - What actually happens instead.  
   - Any visible errors (console, F8, server logs).

6. **Reproduction steps**
   - Short, numbered list that lets us reproduce the issue on a clean test server, for example:
     1. Start the server.  
     2. Join with a fresh character.  
     3. Run `/example`.  
     4. See that the menu does not open and the console prints error `XYZ`.
