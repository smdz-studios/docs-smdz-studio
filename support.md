## 📋 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR SUPPORT

To avoid long back‑and‑forth conversations and to get a useful answer on the first reply, always include:

1. **Script name**  
   - Example: `smdz_example`, `smdz_vehicleshop`, `smdz_dispatch`, etc.

2. **Script version**  
   - Example: `v1.0.3`.  
   - You can usually find this in the config file, the `fxmanifest.lua`, or on the Tebex download page.

3. **Framework and version**
   - ESX / QBCore / Standalone.  
   - If relevant, specify:
     - “ESX Legacy” / “Old ESX”  
     - QBCore fork or commit (if not using the main repo)

4. **Server environment**
   - Local test server / VPS / dedicated machine / game panel.  
   - Operating system (Windows / Linux) and database type (MySQL / MariaDB).

5. **Tebex purchase ID**
   - The **order ID / transaction ID** from Tebex that proves your purchase.  
   - This helps verify ownership and ensure you are running an official version.

6. **Clear description of the issue**
   - What you expected to happen.  
   - What actually happens instead.  
   - Any visible errors (server console, F8 console, client logs).

7. **Reproduction steps**
   - A short, numbered list that allows the issue to be reproduced on a clean test server, for example:
     1. Start the server with only the framework + database adapter + the SMDZ script.  
     2. Join the server with a fresh character.  
     3. Run `/example` or perform the specific action.  
     4. Observe that the menu does not open and error `XYZ` appears in the console.

8. **Configuration snippets (if relevant)**
   - Only include the parts of your config that are related to the problem.  
   - Remove or mask any secrets (webhooks, API keys, passwords) before sharing.

The more precise and complete this information is, the faster SMDZ Studios can identify the root cause and provide a real solution instead of guesses.

## 🧪 BUG REPORTS & QUALITY FEEDBACK

Well‑written bug reports and detailed feedback are extremely valuable.  
They help SMDZ Studios make each script **more stable, faster and easier to configure** for the entire community.

<div class="tip">
  <p>
    When you take the time to reproduce an issue on a clean environment, capture useful logs and describe it
    clearly, you are not just fixing your own problem — you are improving the script for every server that uses it.
  </p>
</div>

When reporting a bug, try to provide:

- ✅ A **minimal test scenario** (for example: only framework + database + the SMDZ script).  
- ✅ The **exact version** of the script and framework.  
- ✅ Full console logs from server startup until the error appears.  
- ✅ Relevant parts of your configuration (with sensitive data removed).  
- ✅ `resmon` screenshots if the bug is related to performance.

If a bug is confirmed, reproducible and has a noticeable impact, SMDZ Studios may, at its sole discretion:

- Offer an additional script copy  
- Apply a discount to a future purchase  
- Provide store credit or a gift card  
- In exceptional cases, grant a **free script** from the shop  

Those rewards are **optional** and decided case‑by‑case after reviewing:

- The severity and impact of the bug  
- How easy it is to reproduce  
- The quality and usefulness of the information you provided

   - Script not starting  
   - Database / SQL issues  
   - Permissions and admin commands  
   - Framework compatibility (ESX / QBCore / Standalone)  
3. Review the **[Asset Escrow System](fxap.md)** page if your problem is related to entitlements or ownership.
