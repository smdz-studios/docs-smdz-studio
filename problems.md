# 🧩 Error: syntax error near '<\1>'

There are two possible ways why this error occurs

* You have used FileZilla which is breaking the structure of the script so please use WinSCP which works as expected and doesn't break anything.\
  \
  If you did not use FileZilla but you "drag and drop it" with Remote Desktop Control that will still damage it, so please drag and drop the zip and unzip it on server do not move it with method "file by file"\\
* Your server is outdated and needs to be at least 4752 or greater.

### 📦 FileZilla set binary mode

If you are using FileZilla try reupload whole resource with binary mode

</div>

#### 🐧 Linux

1. Download the last recommended artifact from this page <https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/>
2. Turn off your server
3. Delete `cache` & `alpine` folder
4. Unzip `fx.tar.xz` with command `tar -xf fx.rar.xz`
5. Start the server and write `version` to see a new version

#### 🪟 Windows

Exactly the same but you use windows FXServer artifact <https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/>

And remove the server folder and replace it with the newly downloaded version.

## 🧯 SCRIPT WON’T START / CRASHES ON STARTUP:

**What you see:**

- Resource never appears as started.
- Console shows red errors when running `ensure` or on server boot.
- `resources list` does not show the script as loaded.

### ✅ A. QUICK CHECKLIST:

```text
[ ] Folder name is correct
[ ] Resource is in the right path
[ ] "ensure" name matches folder
[ ] All dependencies are started FIRST
[ ] No obvious syntax error in config
```

---

### 📁 B. FOLDER NAME / PATH PROBLEMS:

**Symptoms (console examples):**

```text
Could not find resource smdz_example.
Resource smdz_exmaple does not exist.
```

**Steps:**

1. Check the **folder name**:
   - Should be exactly something like:
     ```text
     resources/[smdz]/smdz_example
     ```
2. Check `server.cfg`:
   ```bash
   ensure smdz_example
   ```
3. Avoid:
   - Spaces: `smdz example`
   - Capitalization mismatches: `SMDZ_Example`

---

### 🧩 C. MISSING DEPENDENCIES:

**Look for words like:** `es_extended`, `qb-core`, `oxmysql`, `mysql-async`, `target`, `inventory`.

**Example errors:**

```text
attempt to index a nil value (global 'ESX')
attempt to index a nil value (global 'QBCore')
No such export oxmysql:execute
```

**Steps:**

1. Open the script’s docs page and find the **REQUIREMENTS** section.
2. In `server.cfg`, ensure dependencies start **before** the SMDZ script, e.g.:

   ```bash
   ensure oxmysql
   ensure es_extended   # or qb-core
   ensure smdz_example
   ```

3. Restart the server and re‑check the console.

---

### 🔒 D. ESCROW / ENTITLEMENT ERRORS:

**Examples:**

```text
This asset is not owned by this account
You lack the required entitlement to use smdz_prop_finder
Failed to verify protected resource
```

If you see anything like this, go to:  
👉 **[ASSET ESCROW SYSTEM (CFX.RE / TEBEX)](fxap.md)** for a dedicated guide.

---

### 🧼 E. CACHE CLEANUP (OPTIONAL):

If you just updated resources or configs and still see old behavior:

1. Stop the server.
2. Delete the `cache` and `server-cache` folders (if they exist).
3. Start the server and test again.

# 🗄 **DATABASE & SQL ISSUES:**

**What you see:**

- Tables missing.
- Data not saving.
- Connection or adapter errors.

---

### 🧭 A. QUICK IDENTIFIER:

Check the console for words like:

- `oxmysql`
- `mysql-async`
- `MySQL`
- `table doesn't exist`

---

### 🧱 B. ADAPTER NOT INSTALLED / NOT STARTED:

**Errors:**

```text
[oxmysql] [ERROR] connection failed
[mysql-async] Error: connect ECONNREFUSED
```

**Steps:**

1. Make sure you have **one** DB adapter:

   - Recommended: `oxmysql`
   - Legacy: `mysql-async`

2. Configure it with the correct DB credentials.
3. Start it first in `server.cfg`:

   ```bash
   ensure oxmysql
   ensure es_extended  # or qb-core
   ensure smdz_example
   ```

---

### 🧩 C. MISSING TABLES / MIGRATIONS:

**Errors:**

```text
[oxmysql] [ERROR] Table 'dbname.smdz_example' doesn't exist
```

**Steps:**

1. Look in the script files for `.sql` (e.g. `smdz_example.sql`).
2. In your DB manager (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, DBeaver…):
   - Select your FiveM database.
   - Import the `.sql` file.
3. Restart the server and check again.

---

### 🔑 D. WRONG DATABASE CREDENTIALS:

If the server can’t connect at all:

- Recheck host, user, password, database, port.
- Confirm the DB server accepts connections from your FiveM host.

---

## 👥 PERMISSIONS & ADMIN COMMANDS NOT WORKING:

**What you see:**

- Admin commands do nothing for staff.
- Normal players can run admin commands.
- Messages like **“access denied”**.

---

### 🧭 A. FRAMEWORK PERMISSION CONFIG:

Each framework handles perms differently:

- **ESX** → groups like `user`, `mod`, `admin`, `superadmin`.
- **QBCore** → permission levels, `Group`, etc.

**Steps:**

1. Check script docs for **required group/permission**.
2. For ESX, confirm the player has `group.admin` / `group.superadmin`.
3. For QBCore, use existing permission systems or custom exports to give access.

---

### 🛡️ B. ACE PERMISSIONS:

**Error examples:**

```text
Access denied for command /smdz_admin
```

**Steps:**

1. In `server.cfg`, add something like:

   ```bash
   add_ace group.admin smdz.scripts allow
   add_principal identifier.license:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx group.admin
   ```

2. Replace `identifier.license:...` with your staff licenses.
3. Restart server (or re‑exec these lines) and test again.

---

# 🔑 **FRAMEWORK COMPATIBILITY (ESX / QBCORE / STANDALONE):**

**What you see:**

- Script clearly says “for ESX” or “for QBCore”, but you’re using another framework.
- Functions like `ESX.GetPlayerFromId` or `QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer` are `nil`.

---

### 🧩 A. WRONG FRAMEWORK MODE IN CONFIG:

Look for a setting similar to:

```lua
Config.Framework = 'ESX'       -- 'ESX', 'QBCore' or 'Standalone'
```

**Steps:**

1. Set the value to match your environment.
2. Confirm the chosen framework is actually installed and started.

---

### 🧱 B. FRAMEWORK START ORDER:

Make sure frameworks start **before** SMDZ scripts:

```bash
ensure es_extended   # or qb-core
ensure smdz_example
```

---

## 🎛 CONFIGURATION MISTAKES:

**What you see:**

- No obvious console error, but the script doesn’t behave as expected.
- Blips not showing, zones not working, features half‑active.

---

### 🧭 A. COMPARE WITH DEFAULT CONFIG:

1. Take your current `config.lua`.
2. Compare it with the **fresh config** from a clean download.
3. Look for:
   - Removed lines.
   - Wrong types (string instead of number, etc.).
   - Invalid coordinates.

---

### ⚠️ B. COMMON CONFIG PITFALLS:

- Empty required fields (e.g. webhooks, keys).
- Typos in enum values (`ESX` vs `esx`, etc.).
- Coordinates in the wrong format:

  ```lua
  -- GOOD:
  vector3(215.0, -810.0, 30.0)

  -- RISKY:
  { x = 215, y = -810 }  -- if script expects vector3
  ```

---

# 🎨 **UI / NOTIFICATIONS / TARGET INTEGRATIONS:**

**What you see:**

- Looking at an entity does nothing (no target).
- Menus don’t open, but there’s no clear error.
- Notifications never appear.

---

### 🧭 A. IDENTIFY WHICH SYSTEM YOU USE:

Check your own resources:

- Target: `qb-target`, `ox_target`, `qtarget`, etc.
- Notifications: `ox_lib`, `mythic_notify`, `okokNotify`, etc.

Then open the script config. You’ll often see:

```lua
Config.Target      = 'qb-target'   -- 'ox_target', 'qtarget', etc.
Config.Notification = 'ox_lib'     -- 'mythic', 'okok', etc.
```

**Steps:**

1. Set these values to match your actual resources.
2. Check that those resources are started.
3. Restart the server and test again.

---

# 🌍 **PERFORMANCE & TICK USAGE:**

**What you see:**

- Players report “lag”.
- You suspect a script might be heavy.

---

### ⏱️ A. MEASURE FIRST:

Use the built‑in profiler:

```text
resmon 1
```

Look specifically at the line for the SMDZ script, e.g. `smdz_example`.

- **Idle usage** in ms should be low.
- Compare with other heavy scripts on your server.

---

### 🧰 B. IF USAGE IS HIGH:

1. Check config for:
   - Tight loops (e.g. every `0` or `0.01` seconds).
   - Large scan ranges or many entities.
2. Try:
   - Increasing timers slightly.
   - Disabling optional, heavy features (e.g. debug visuals).
3. Test on a **clean server** with only the framework + SMDZ script to isolate.

If it still seems heavy, gather:

- `resmon` screenshot.
- Player count.
- Your config file.

…then contact support.

---

# 📬 **WHEN TO CONTACT SUPPORT:**

If you have gone through:

- The **section that matches your error**, and
- The script’s dedicated documentation page,

…but the problem persists, it’s time to open a ticket.

---

### 🧾 PREPARE THIS INFORMATION:

```text
• Script name:         smdz_example
• Script version:      v1.0.0
• Framework:           ESX / QBCore / Standalone
• Tebex purchase ID:   ################
